Start matlab; startup.m will run automatically and set up your path.

To test, run unittest.m .

To check gradients, run:

check_a_conv.m
check_phi.m

To collect all the individually saved basis function images into a movie,
edit fig_avi.m and set paramstr to the paramstr you would like to watch
evolve, then run fig_avi.m .
